# Abstract

The GBIF backbone taxonomy contains numerous duplicate taxa due to unrecognised synonyms being included two or more times. These synonyms may be linked to distinct occurrence data, such that a search on one name is unlikely to retrieve all occurrence data for the corresponding taxon. The potential extent of hidden synonymy is quantified in several taxonomic groups, and visualised using cluster maps.

# Introduction

Taxonomic names are the default global identifier for biodiversity information [Sarkar 2007][Patterson et al. 2010]. However, they are poorly equipped for this role [Kennedy et al. 2005]. Ideally an identifier would be stable, the entity it identifies would itself be stable (or, at least, its boundaries be uncontested), and there would be a single way to display the identifier. All of these desirable attributes are missing from taxonomic names. Names carry semantic information, or at least biologists treat the names as being meaningful. For example, inclusion of chimps and gorillas in the genus *Homo* [Wildman et al. 2003] carries with it legal implications regarding our treatment of our closest living relatives [Taylor 2001]. The genus part of a species name is expected to be a reliable indicator of that species' relationships, such that species in the same genus are expected to be more closely related to each other than to species in other genera. When it becomes apparent that this is not the case, taxonomists will typically redistribute the species across genera until a more satisfactory arrangement is arrived at. The resulting name changes come at the potential cost of disrupting communication, sometimes to an extent that the change is resisted. The fruit fly *Drosophila melanogaster* is a case in point [Dalton 2010].

Even the basic requirement that there be a single way of representing an identifier is violated. A taxonomic name may be written with or without the taxon authority (the name of the taxonomist(s) who coined the name) and, depending on rank, there may be more than one way to write the same name. For example, if we follow [Prouty et al. 1983] and place the white-faced gibbon in the subgenus *Bunopithecus* (Matthew and Granger 1923) we could write the taxonomic name as either *Hylobates hoolock* or *Hylobates (Bunopithecus) hillock*.

This multiplicity of names complicates the task of aggregating biodiversity data at a global scale. If different data sources use different names for the same taxon and the aggregator isn't aware that the names are synonyms, the aggregator will not merge the different data sets together correctly. The Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) is the largest aggregator of fundamental biodiversity data, focussing on observations of organisms that are tied to a particular place and time ("what", "where", and "when"). It mobilises data from a wide variety of sources, each of which may follow its own convention for which name to use for a given taxon. This can lead to instances where GBIF has multiple records for the same taxon. As an example, consider the White-browed Gibbon. Since its original description as *Simia hoolock* by [Harlan 1834], this gibbon has been variously assigned the genera *Hylobates*, *Bunopithecus*, and most recently, *Hoolock* [Mootnick and Grove 2005], hence the gibbon has been known as *Hylobates hoolock*, *Bunopithecus hoolock*, and *Hoolock hoolock*. Ideally a biodiversity database containing information on this species would be aware of this synonymy and return information on this species regardless of which name the user has chosen. However, GBIF returns different results for each name (Fig. GIBBONS).

Fig. GIBBONS. The three taxonomic names for the white-faced gibbon in GBIF database, together with the source of the name, the number of occurrence records linked to that name, and a map of those occurrences that have been georeferenced (GBIF data accessed 2013-09-17). Note that the data returned for each name is different.

A user searching GBIF for, say, the name of the white-faced gibbon used by the IUCN red list (*Hoolock hoolock*) will think GBIF has virtually no relevant data on the distribution of this taxon. They would need to know about the synonymy of this ape in order to locate the additional data in GBIF that is associated with the other names. Note that this issue is not unique to GBIF: the [Map of Life project](http://www.mappinglife.org/) [Jetz et al. 2012] suffers from the same problem. Searching on the three different taxonomic names for the white-faced gibbon results in three different maps (Fig. MOL) with no indication that these are for the same taxon.

In addition to reducing the success of users searching for data in GBIF, unrecognised synonyms may potentially impact users' perception of the reliability of GBIF-mobilised data. GBIF users consistently rank taxonomic data (names and checklists) as one of the most important type of data for their needs [Ari√±o et al. 2013]. It would therefore be desirable if the quality of this data was as high as possible. Based on the white-faced gibbon example (Fig. GIBBONS), and other examples discovered while exploring the GBIF taxonomy [Page 2013b][Page 2013c] I decided to explore the extent to which GBIF is affected by unrecognised taxonomic synonyms. I have restricted this investigation to animal names so that I could make use of [BioNames](http://bionames.org) [Page 2013d] to investigate particular names in more detail.

## Methods

The current GBIF backbone classification was downloaded as a Darwin Core Archive [Wieczorek et al. 2012] from http://uat.gbif.org/dataset/d7dddbf4-2cf0-4f39-9b2a-bb099caae36c on 4th September 2013 and loaded into a MySQL database. 

A range of taxa were selected for investigation, based on preliminary browsing of the GBIF classification, and the availability of detailed data on taxonomic names for that taxonomic group. Fig. TERMINOLOGY indicates the terminology for the parts of taxonomic names adopted here, using the example of *Pithecanthropus erectus* Dubois, 1894 and its synonym *Homo erectus* (Dubois, 1894). Note that if we did not know that these  two names were synonyms we could infer it by noting that the two names share the same specific epithet and authorship, and the genera *Pithecanthropus* and *Homo* are related. This suggests that a quick way of detecting possible synonyms is to find instances of species in different genera within the same family that have the same specific epithet. Given that the specific epithet is often descriptive, or may be named after a person or place, it is not uncommon for two different species in two distinct genera to have the same epithet. We can endeavour to minimise false matches by including (where available) the taxonomic authority. Names will then only be incorrectly flagged if the same taxonomic authority published used the same epithet for more than one species in the same year. Such false positives do, of course, exist (see example in the results), so names meeting this criterion of belonging to the same family and having the same specific epithet will be termed "problematic" rather than "synonyms". In specific cases given adequate access to taxonomic databases or the primary literature we can establish whether such problematic taxa are, indeed, synonyms. Conversely, the approached used here may also underestimate the number of problematic taxa. It does not account for variations in spelling caused by either typographic errors or changes in species names required to agree with the gender of the genus name. 

![TERMINOLOGY](https://raw.github.com/rdmpage/taxonomy-GBIF-manuscript/master/figures/terminology.png)

Fig. TERMINOLOGY Terminology of taxonomic names. A binomial species name comprises a genus part, a specific epithet, and the authorship. The genus a species is first described in is the "original combination". A species may be subsequently moved to a different genus, resulting in a "new combination".

For each family the accepted species- and subspecies-level in each genus were extracted from the local copy of the GBIF database. Where available, the taxon authorship was appended, after first removing commas and parentheses, the later are used to indicate that the species was not originally described in that genus. For example, given the name *Homo erectus* (Dubois, 1894) we can infer that Dubois did not originally place this species in the genus *Homo* (he described it as *Pithecanthropus erectus* [Dubois 1894]). The parentheses were removed to simplify matching taxon authorship (their presence is also not always a reliable indicator of whether a genus + specific epithet is the original combination or not). 


## Visualisation

Potential inconsistencies in nomenclature within a family-level taxon were visualised using "cluster maps" [Fluit et al. 2006]. Cluster maps are graphs comprising two classes of nodes, one representing a category, the other representing clusters of objects that belong to one or of those categories. All objects that belong in the same category are in the same cluster, and each cluster is connected to each category that its members belong too. In this context the categories are generic names, and the objects being clustered are specific epithets (plus authorship where available).

Fig. CLUSTER shows a cluster map for the three gibbon genera that the white-faced gibbon has been assigned to. The categories are the three generic names (*Bunopithecus*, *Hoolock*, and *Hylobates*), and the clusters contain the species names. The names that occur in combination with only a single genus are in clusters with a single edge linking that cluster to the corresponding genus. For example, there are three names that are unique to *Bunopithecus*, and 27 names that only appear in the genus *Hylobates*. The specific epithet "*hoolock* Harlan 1834" occurs in cluster by itself, linked to the three generic names (*Bunopithecus*, *Hoolock*, and *Hylobates*) with which it has been combined in the GBIF database. Note that there is another species name (*leuconedys* Groves 1967) that occurs in GBIF in more than one genus *Bunopithecus leuconedys* and *Hoolock leuconedys*.

## Metrics

To provide a quick way to scan results for possible problematic taxa I developed a number of measures derived from the cluster map. A graph comprises nodes and edges, and the number of edges connected to a node is that node's degree. If there were no problematic taxa then each genus would be connected to a single cluster, so each genus node would have degree = 1 as would each cluster node. The greater the degree of a genus node the greater the number of other genera that have been home to its species.

The greater the degree of a cluster node the more genera are in contention for the species in that cluster (for example, the *hoolock* cluster has degree 3, corresponding to the genera (*Bunopithecus*, *Hoolock*, and *Hylobates*). If there were no problematic species names then the number of species names in the clusters would correspond to the number of taxa. In the gibbon example there were 35 distinct species and subspecies names, but only 32 names are in the clusters. Because the specific epithet "*hoolock*" occurs in three genera it occurs once in a single cluster (3 - 1 = 2), and likewise the name "*leuconedys*" occurs in two genera but a single cluster (2 - 1 = 1), so there are 2 + 1 = 3 fewer names in the clusters than in the original list.

### Typographic errors

Although the method used here cannot handle changes in the spelling of the specific epithet it can detect some spelling inconsistencies in generic names. For example, in the wasp family Evaniidae GBIF has two generic names, *Szepligetella* sourced from The Catalogue of Life, 3rd January 2011 and *Szepligetiella* (note the extra "i") sourced from the Interim Register of Marine and Nonmarine Genera (Fig. Evaniidae). The correct spelling is  *Szepligetella* (see [Bradley 1908]), so the 14 species belonging to *Szepligetiella* duplicate the 14 from *Szepligetella*. Note that one specific epithet (*similis* Sz√©pligeti 1903) is shared with a third genus *Hyptia*. This is a false positive, in that *Szepligetella similis* was originally described as *Evania similis* and *Hyptia similis* is the original name for a different species (both *Evania similis* and *Hyptia similis* were described in the same publication on pages 385 and 376 respectively; [Sz√©pligeti 1903]).

# Discussion

The quality of GBIF data has come under increasing scrutiny [Yesson et al. 2007][Gaiji et al. 2013][Mesibov, 2013][Otegui et al. 2013a], which may also reflect increasing use of its data. Given the scale of GBIF's ambition (mobilising the world's biodiversity data), the multiplicity of data providers, and variation in the quality of that data, it is inevitable that there will be errors. By themselves, the presence of errors matters less than the speed with which they are identified and corrected [Birney 2012]. Furthermore, errors may exist but not have a significant impact on the kinds of uses to which the data are being put [Belbin et al. 2013].

But the inconsistency in the GBIF taxonomy is worrying, particularly as its extent seems unrecognised. GBIF is dependent on the quality of its source data bases, but many taxonomic databases are little more than lists of names that have an imprimatur of authority stamped on them. The names themselves are rarely linked to the primary taxonomic literature, making it difficult for a user to investigate further and establish the status of a contested name. Given that we have multiple databases and multiple authorities, reconciling name lists becomes an exercise in comparative trust (which authority is more authoritative?). The very existence of multiple "authoritative" sources for the taxonomy of the same group of organisms suggests that different authorities may have different goals and hence different classifications. In the case of mammals, there are at least three major sources of names harvested by GBIF: the Catalogue of Life, the IUCN Red List, and Mammal Species of the World. A cluster map of the accepted species names recognised by each database (Fig. Mammals) reveals that all three sources recognise names that are not recognised by either of the other two databases.

![Mammals](https://raw.github.com/rdmpage/taxonomy-GBIF-manuscript/master/figures/mammal-species.png)

Fig. Mammals. Cluster map for accepted species names for mammals according to three different taxonomic databases. The largest cluster represents names found in all three databases. Clusters linked to a single database are unique to that source.

Unless one database is more up to date than another and includes newly described species (new mammals are still being discovered; [Ceballos and Ehrlich 2009]) one might expect that the names unique to one or more database should be either objective synonyms (the same taxa placed in different genera) or represent disputes about the delimitation of taxa. 


## Future directions

There are some practical steps that GBIF could take to help reduce the impact of unrecognised synonyms. It could add additional taxonomic databases that include synonymy data. It may be that existing providers have this data already. For example, the IUCN Red List of threatened species dataset http://uat.gbif.org/dataset/19491596-35ae-4a91-9a98-85cf505f1bd3 does include synonym data that does not appear to have been harvested by GBIF. It may also need to apply more stringent filters to some data sources. Some names in GBIF appear to be database artefacts or misspellings. These may be caught by more sophisticated data cleaning methods.

But the larger task facing the zoological taxonomy community is the lack of one of the most basic requirements for successful data integration using taxonomic names, a database of synonyms. If taxonomic practice makes it inevitable that name changes will occur as species are shuffled around genera, then arguably it is incumbent on the community to provide tools that shield the broader biological community from the consequences of that practice.

We can greatly improve on this situation by explicitly linking names and changes in names (e.g., synonym) to the primary literature. The plant and fungal communities have made considerable progress towards this goal with resources such as IPNI [http://www.ipni.org] and Index Fungorum [http://www.indexfungorum.org]. The zoological community is not so well placed. There are some excellent taxon-specific database, but no freely available global database of animal names and their synonyms, linked to the primary literature.
